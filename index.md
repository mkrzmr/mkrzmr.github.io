## Welcome to my site.

I am a fourth-year PhD student at the Centre for Digital Humanities at Maynooth University. My research interest is hacktivism as a tool in political communication. My thesis investigates political web defacements as a method of contesting online space. I am a recipient of the Irish Research Council Postgraduate Scholarship.

### Engaging with Web Archives [EWA] is the first Irish Web Archiving Conference. Most papers are available here: https://ewaconference.com/


=======
### I have started to compile a reading list of essentials works around the effects of digital communication.




This simple page is the continuation of a blog I started in 2017. A few blog entries have been carried over. It will be continuously expanded to reflect my teaching and learning.
