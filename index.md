## Welcome to my site.

I am a third-year PhD student at the Centre for Digital Humanities at Maynooth University. My research interest is hacktivism as a tool in political communication. My thesis investigates political web defacements as a method of contesting online space. I am a recipient of the Irish Research Council Postgraduate Scholarship.

This simple page is the continuation of a blog I started in 2017. A few blog entries have been carried over. It will be continuously expanded to reflect my teaching and learning.
